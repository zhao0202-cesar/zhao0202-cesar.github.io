                        Jadeland Restaurant has become known as one of the finest Chinese restaurants in Chinatown. We have been committed to providing the Ottawa valley with the finest and most unique combination of excellent cuisine, friendly service, and the best prices.  Numerous write-ups in newspapers, magazines, national and international travel guides have attested to the quality of our food and service. We use only the freshest ingredients with a highlight on local produce. Live fish and crab are brought to the table for your inspection (we take our food and our customers very seriously) by one of our friendly staff. Minutes later, our award winning chefs will present you with the most mouth-watering dishes for you in this part of the world.
                        This venue specializes in Cantonese and Szechuan food. Cantonese cooking being milder, but with more variety. Szechuan cuisine is a traditional style that comes from an area in China that is blessed with naturally growing chile peppers. Thus the cuisine is more savoury and also for those with the acquired taste, hot.
